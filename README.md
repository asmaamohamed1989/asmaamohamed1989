- 👋 Hi, I’m @asmaamohamed1989
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learnig and Deep Learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer vision
  
- 💞️ I am a researcher with excellent skills in machine learning, deep learning, and Computer Vision tasks. I have experience with the programming languages Python and C++. True team player with strengths in adaptability and accuracy.

I am working with machine learning and deep learning skills for multiple applications, including Computer Vision. Also, I have experience in python programming language, its libraries, and frameworks such as Tensorflow and Keras.
a full scholarship from Information Technology Institute to study artificial intelligence Engineering (powered by EPITA)


More than 9 years of experience in scientific research, specifically in machine learning and data mining in my Master's degree and IoT, cloud computing, and deep learning in my PhD.

Teaching assistant at the faculty of science, Al- Azhar University(since 2019 till now) 

Teaching assistant at Al –Alson High Institute of tourism, hotels, and Computer Science (from 2012 to 2018).

My background in Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning algorithms, and management informs my mindful but competitive approach.

​I've always had a sense of motivation and passion driving me forward from a young age. Whether exploring unique opportunities, learning additional skills, or meeting new people, I bring these values to every experience throughout my life on a personal and professional level.

My current research interests are in the area of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and
their applications.

Throughout the last 9 years, I have worked on many aspects of machine learning applications in
image processing and deep learning in data fusion in the IoTs environments.

I have worked on classification algorithms and feature selection strategies in medical image processing.

In the next years, I plan to continue my efforts in machine learning research. On the
On the one hand, I want to focus on technical solutions to utilize the learning algorithms efficiently and
their applications.
